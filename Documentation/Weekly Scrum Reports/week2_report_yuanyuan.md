# Weekly Report

#### Week: #<2>
#### Name: Yuanyuan Qu

## 01 What was accomplished last week
- Defined the necessary message classes required for client-server communication (client-side)
- Before the basic game logic was completed, I built a simple mock client that could connect to server written by Yili.
- After the game logic is completed, I built a basic connection between the GUI and client-server (after clicking button "join new game")
- Updated the necessary configurations in "build.gralde" for client-server (moshi)

## 02 What's planned until next week
- Continue to implement Client and ClientController based on game logic model (handle message from server and update view)

## 03 What went well
- We have clear division of tasks and smooth communication. Our progress so far is also going smoothly.
- Pair programming with Yili is also going well.

## 04 What were there problems with
- So far there is no significant problem.

## 05 Feedback to the team and tutor
- Everyone is doing a great job! Let's keep going step by step!
